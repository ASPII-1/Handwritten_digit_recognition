# Handwritten_digit_recognition
This repository contains code for a handwritten digit recognition system using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and a hybrid architecture that leverages the strengths of both CNN and LSTM.

# Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and deep learning. This project explores three different approaches to solving this problem:

CNN-based Model: A Convolutional Neural Network is used to extract features from the input images and classify them.

LSTM-based Model: A Long Short-Term Memory network is used to capture sequential patterns in the pixel values of the images.

Hybrid CNN-LSTM Model: This architecture combines the power of CNNs for spatial feature extraction with the sequence modeling capabilities of LSTMs.
